<h2>Vaccination</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose you are the president of Joy Land. Everything was great until a mysterious disease broke out in your country. As a leader, you asked your scientist to synthesize vaccines to fight the disease. Your capable scientist was able to develop a vaccine but they warned you not to use it on a certain age group as shown by the <code class="java">notAllowedAgeGroup</code> set. Now you have to address the nation and tell the citizens about the latest development. In the news headlines, you want the age group eligible for vaccination to flash. For that you need to have an EnumSet that contains code for allowed age groups. Your task is to create such a set and print it.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight"></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">[AGE_18_TO_45, AGE_46_TO_60, AGE_60_ABOVE]</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
